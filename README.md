## Problem Statement
The healthcare industry faces challenges in early diagnosis due to limited resources and delayed testing. This project uses ML models to predict the likelihood of diseases using structured patient health data.

## Dataset
- ~10,000 records
- Features: Age, gender, blood pressure, glucose, BMI, smoking, cholesterol, activity, medical history
- Target: Disease presence (Yes/No or multi-class)

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Performance
- Best model: Random Forest (~92% accuracy)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

## Future Work
- Time-series data integration
- Web/Mobile deployment
- Real clinical dataset validation

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
2. Run `source_code.py`
